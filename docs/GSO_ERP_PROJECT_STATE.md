# GSO ERP Project State

## Current Repo And Branch

- Repo path: `C:\Users\golde\GSO-ERP-WORKSPACE\wholesale-lite-mvp`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest stable commit: `4adbcbe Extract shared recipe pricing engine`
- Working tree at closeout: Patch 3 (production-after-full-payment gate) pending commit

## Golden Rule For All Agents

- Do not restart the project.
- Read this file before planning or patching.
- Do not change files outside the allowed list.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly told.
- Always report changed files, build result, git status, and risks.
- For any route/schema/security change, plan first, patch second, audit third.
- Use small reversible phases.

## Completed Milestone: Agent Review Queue

Stable routes:

- `/app/erp/agent-review-queue`
- `/app/erp/agent-review-queue/new`

Working features:

- Staff can manually create internal queue items.
- Queue creation writes `AgentReviewQueueItem` and `AgentReviewQueueEvent`.
- Queue list is shop-scoped and admin-authenticated.
- Staff can update safe statuses inline.
- Status actions write `AgentReviewQueueEvent`.
- Reject and Missing info require notes.
- Notes are stored in audit event metadata.
- Audit summary column shows latest event/count.
- Status filters work:
  - All
  - Staff review
  - Missing info
  - Cost review
  - Ready
  - Rejected
  - Archived

Important caution:

- Dynamic detail route `/app/erp/agent-review-queue/:id` caused Shopify embedded login loop and was reverted.
- Query-param item detail panel also caused Shopify embedded login loop and was reverted.
- Do not re-add detail routes.
- Do not add `itemId` query detail behavior.
- Do not add selected queue item detail lookup.

## Completed Milestone: Secure Sales-Agent Intake

Stable endpoint:

- `POST /api/agent/intake`

Read-only rule endpoints:

- `/app/erp/agent-product-rules`
- `/app/erp/agent-intake-rules`
- `/app/erp/agent-quote-prep-rules`
- `/app/erp/agent-quote-prep-draft-shape`
- `/app/erp/agent-review-queue-rules`

Schema models:

- `AgentApiCredential`
- `AgentSubmissionLog`
- `AgentReviewQueueItem`
- `AgentReviewQueueEvent`

`/api/agent/intake` behavior:

- POST-only
- JSON-only
- raw-body HMAC verified before JSON parsing
- 32KB body limit
- no CORS headers
- no Shopify admin auth dependency
- not an embedded app route

Auth requires:

- `Authorization: Bearer <tokenId>.<tokenSecret>`
- `X-GSO-Agent-Timestamp`
- `X-GSO-Agent-Signature`

Confirmed security behavior:

- token hash comparison uses timing-safe comparison
- HMAC signature comparison uses timing-safe comparison
- timestamp tolerance is enforced
- ambiguous active `tokenId` matches are rejected
- revoked credentials are rejected
- shop comes only from `credential.shop`

Live tests passed:

- `GET /api/agent/intake` returned 405
- JSON POST without auth returned 401
- `text/plain` returned 415
- valid signed request returned 201
- one `AgentReviewQueueItem` was created
- duplicate idempotency request returned 200 duplicate true
- test credential was revoked
- no quote/order/message/production behavior was created

## Safety Boundaries

Agent endpoint may create only:

- `AgentReviewQueueItem`
- `AgentReviewQueueEvent`
- `AgentSubmissionLog`
- optional `AgentApiCredential.lastUsedAt` / `lastUsedIpHash`

Agent endpoint must not create:

- real quotes
- quote approvals
- final pricing
- Shopify draft orders
- invoices
- customer messages
- production jobs
- Shopify edits
- ERP product edits

## Existing Quote Recipe Safety Gates

Quote recipe gates remain:

- `active: true`
- `useInQuotes: true`
- `costReviewNeeded: false`

## Completed Milestone: Quote Payment Status Flow (Patch 1)

- `webhooks.orders_paid.tsx` classifies quote payments as deposit / balance / full via order tags, note text, and line-item properties.
- Deposit payment sets `Quote.status = "deposit_paid"` and never marks the quote fully paid.
- Balance payment marks the quote `paid` only after the deposit is confirmed paid.
- Full payment marks the quote `paid`.
- Unclassifiable quote payments change nothing (fail closed) and are flagged in the webhook response text.
- Payments append `[GSO] ... invoice paid (Shopify order ...)` audit lines to `Quote.notes`.
- Quote status list: draft, sent, approved, deposit_paid, paid, production, completed.

## Completed Milestone: Shared Recipe Pricing Engine (Patch 2)

- Engine lives in `app/lib/recipe-pricing.server.ts`; finish presets in `app/lib/finish-presets.ts`.
- Exports: `QUOTE_READY_RECIPE_WHERE`, `QUOTE_RECIPE_PRICING_INCLUDE`, `priceRecipeAtQuantity`, `blockingConversionIssues`.
- Quotes / CRM `priceRecipeLine` and Agent Review Queue conversion both price through this engine.
- Queue conversion is fail-closed: no unambiguous recipe, non-positive unit cost or price, missing in-house inputs (width/height, materials, preferred machine), or quantity below recipe minimum = no draft quote.
- `defaultSellPrice` and `SourcedCostTier` no longer drive queue conversion pricing.

## Completed Milestone: Production After Full Payment (Patch 3)

- Owner rule: production starts only after full payment, never after deposit alone.
- Quotes / CRM offers Create Production Job only for `paid` or `production` quotes.
- Server gates in `app.quotes.tsx` and `app.erp.production.tsx` reject job creation for draft/sent/approved/deposit_paid quotes.
- `deposit_paid` rejection message: "Balance must be paid before production can start."
- Opening an already-existing production job remains allowed.
- The paid-order webhook (configurator auto-jobs from paid Shopify orders) is unchanged.

## Product Builder / Product Setup Scope

Current ERP/Product Builder priority:

- blank jars
- stickers / die cut stickers / regular stickers
- banners
- custom/other as safe catch-all

Stock bag configurator remains separate.
Do not build label-only/application options for 4x5 bags unless explicitly requested.

## Intentionally Deferred

- durable rate limiting
- credential management UI
- real production agent credentials
- mockup/approval package workflow
- customer-facing quote sending

## Next Major Phase

Patch 4 (per aligned roadmap):
Quote -> Shopify draft order safety.

Goal:

- Draft order / invoice intents require quote status `approved`.
- Duplicate-creation guards on deposit/balance/full order flags.
- Invoice email split into an explicit separate staff action.
- Balance amount computed from stored `depositAmount`.

Still not allowed:

- external-agent quote/order/production creation
- customer-facing sends without explicit staff action
- production before full payment
- bypassing recipe gates (`active`, `useInQuotes`, `costReviewNeeded: false`)

## Tool Workflow

Use:

- ChatGPT project chat as project brain, roadmap, safety controller, and prompt writer.
- Claude/Fable 5 for larger coding/refactor execution when useful.
- Codex for focused repo patches, audits, and build verification.
- Render for live deploy, DB sync, shell testing.
- PowerShell for git commits, pushes, and local checks.

Every coding-agent prompt should start with:

```text
Read docs/GSO_ERP_PROJECT_STATE.md first.
Do not restart the project.
Do not change files outside the allowed list.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly told.
Report changed files, build result, git status, and risks.
```
